Summary: We explored the Solow Growth Model (a macroeconomic differential equation) and added some extensions to it to test its validity.

During the Fall 2023 semester, I worked on a group project where we explored the Solow Growth Model and added a few variations.
The Solow Growth Model is a macroeconomic model that shows a country's GDP over time based on a number of factors, such as starting capital, savings rate, and worker productivity.
<br>
Our project explored how the model would change if one accounted for wars, changes in population dynamics, technology shocks, variable worker productivity, and other factors.

I've attached a pdf of our paper below.
